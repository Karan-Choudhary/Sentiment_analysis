* Docker is used for containerization.

### Requirements
* [Create a new virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
* Python 3.6 or greater.
* Run Command-
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage:
* For Training the model, run:
```
BuildTrain.bat (For Windows)
``` 
* Put you own data in ***BTsrc/data*** directory named as airline_sentiment_analysis.csv
* Saved model will be saved in ***BTsrc/app/saved_models*** directory.
* To test the api, build the docker image using command:

docker build -t sentiment_analysis .
```
